# Laser-Engraving-Machine

With   90% waste material created a 100% efficient laser engraving machine that moves on x and y plane with the help of stepper motors and engrave the wood.
To construct a CNC laser engraver from the specified components, begin by building a sturdy frame/base with ACP sheet, ensuring space for mounting the Arduino UNO and CNC Shield. Attach the A4988 drivers to the CNC Shield and position the 250 MW Laser to allow free movement along the X and Y axes. Connect the stepper motors from the old DVD writer to the A4988 drivers, ensuring correct wiring for stepper motor phases. Wire the CNC Shield to the Arduino UNO and connect the 12 Volt SMPS to power the stepper motors. For laser control, connect the 250 MW Laser to an IRFZ44N MOSFET, ensuring proper power and ground connections. Program the Arduino UNO with CNC control software, capable of interpreting G-code to control both stepper motors and the laser. Test the system by jogging the stepper motors and ensuring the laser turns on and off as intended. Calibrate the CNC machine for accurate movement along the X and Y axes, adjusting settings in the control program as necessary. Implement safety features in the program to ensure secure laser operation and always wear safety glasses when the laser is operational. Secure all connections, double-check wiring, and make any necessary adjustments for the finalization of the CNC laser engraver.
